Hi! 👋🏼

I'm a senior software developer specialised in web development. 

I've worked in backends and frontends for domains such as health care, tourism, risk management or banking, using clean code to solve business problems. 

I'm a thoughtful, autonomous, open-minded, problem driven, product developer. And I'm always willing to learn and share my knowledge.

I'm a senior software engineer specialized in SaaS applications.

I've worked in back-ends and front-ends for domains such as banking, accounting, health care, tourism or risk management, using code to solve business problems since 2012.

I'm a thoughtful, autonomous, open-minded, problem driven developer. I'm always willing to learn and share knowledge and I like minimalist, well-crafted code.

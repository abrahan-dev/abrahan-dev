# About Me

Senior software developer specializing in web (SaaS) applications (+10 yrs). Experienced in backend and frontend across industries like banking, accounting, healthcare, tourism, and risk management, with a primary focus on backend engineering.

Proficient in TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, Bun, and PHP (strong experience with Zend, some work with Laravel/Symfony), plus databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Worked with frontend technologies, mainly Vue and some React (Next.js). Quick to adapt to new frameworks and methodologies.

Passionate about clean code, AI-driven workflows, problem-solving, and project management.

I prefer leadership roles (Lead Developer, Technical Lead) but am open to opportunities like Junior CTO, Engineering Manager, Quality Assurance, or Senior Developer.

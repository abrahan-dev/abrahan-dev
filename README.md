Hi! 👋🏼

I'm a senior / lead developer specialised in web development (SaaS/Cloud applications) and I love crafting software. I'm currently living in Lyon, France. 🇫🇷🇪🇸🇬🇧

I've worked in backends and frontends for domains such as health care, tourism, risk management or banking, bringing simplicity and clean code to business needs.

I'm thoughtful, autonomous, open-minded, and I'm always willing to learn and share my knowledge.

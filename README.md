I'm a senior software developer specialised in SaaS applications.

I've worked in backends and frontends for domains such as health care, tourism, risk management or banking, using clean code to solve business problems since 2012.

I'm a thoughtful, autonomous, open-minded, problem driven developer. I'm always willing to learn and share knowledge and I like minimalist, well-crafted code.

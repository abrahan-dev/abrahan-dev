Hi! 👋🏼

I'm a senior developer specialised in web development. 

I've worked in backends and frontends for complex applications in domains such as health care, tourism, risk management or banking.  

I'm thoughtful, autonomous, open-minded, and I'm always willing to learn and share my knowledge.

⚠️ I'm not interested in new job opportunities for now. Thank you recruiters of the world.
